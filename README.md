## Hi there  <img src="assets/hi.gif" width="80" />

I’m kind of developer.

My main programming languages are C# and Java.
Also worked a bit with react.

Mostly working on Unity games and Minecraft mods, but also have a bunch of small projects.

Great part of my old projects aren’t on Github, because I didn’t knew about it when started and now I’m too lazy to add them. Maybe, sometimes.

(not) Fun fact about me:
- I have big problems with finishing and releasing projects. Despite years of developing I have only few small releases <img src="assets/ultramad.png" width="25" />
